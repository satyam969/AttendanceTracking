# Attendance Management System

This is an **Attendance Management System** built using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Supabase**. The system is designed with enhanced security where direct signup is not allowed; only admins can manually add users. Users can submit screenshots for check-in, check-out, and their work progress with descriptions. Admins can efficiently track and filter attendance records.

## Features

âœ… Admin-only user registration for added security.  
âœ… Users can submit screenshots for:
- Check-in
- Check-out
- Work progress with descriptions  
âœ… Admin panel for viewing and filtering records based on:
- Employee name
- Date of work  
âœ… Uses **Supabase** for database management and secure API integration.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js** (Framework)
- **TypeScript** (Strongly typed codebase)
- **Supabase** (Database & Auth)
- **Tailwind CSS** (Styling)
